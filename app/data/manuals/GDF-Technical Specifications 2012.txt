longitudinal and transversal structure, vacuum consolidate
and postcured at 45 degrees C,

Deck will be laminated to the hull. The bonding lamination
will be post-cured.

Cabon fibre and hybrids will be extensively used for the
construction of hull, deck and structural bulkheads. Glass
fibre will be used where suitable to optimise the
performance of the lamination.

Core material will Corecell, with variable density or solid
laminate in way of loaded fittings, concentrated loads and
slamming area.

Epoxy resin system will be adpoted.

Shear ties will be incorporated in the sandwich lamination.
All openings in hull and deck will have radiused corners
and local additional reinforcement, capping and/or collars
to maintain the structural integrity and rigidity.

Openings or fittings which interrupt the longitudinal
stiffening members of hull and deck (unidirectional tape,
longitudinal stiffening members, etc.), will be suitable
compensated.

Changes in laminate thickness will be gradual.

Changes from sandwich laminate to solid laminate will
have a core taper of approx. 1:3.

Framing and stiffener sections will be built up layer by
layer using vacuum consolidation. Particular attention will
be paid to achieve a satisfactory bond and structural
continuity at the ends and intersections with other
structural members.

Discontinuities and sharp points in the structure will be
avoided, and where the strenght of a stiffening member is
impaired by any attachment of fttings, openings, drainage
arrangements, etc., compensation by mean of additional
lamination has to be provided.

Secondary bonding onto cured laminates ¡is to be carried
out after suitable preparation of existing laminate. This
includes, removal of peel ply, saning, degreasing and
drying as applicable to form high quality secondary bonds.
Suitable fillets and radiuses will be provided in way of
changes in laminate direction.

Exposed edges of laminate cut in solid laminate will be
sealed with resin, it the edge is in direct contact with sea
water a capping of reinforcement will be provided.
Exposed edges of laminate cut in sandwich panels will
generally be sealed with a reinforcement of weight equal
to that of the outer skin of the sandwich laminate unless
otherwise specified.

Limber holes will be arranged to provide drainage of any
areas likely to accumulate liquids.

No limber holes will be fitted in way of junctions of internal
structure, unless specified.

All limber holes cut in the structures will be reinforced with
half tube laminated to the hull or an equivalent
arrangement agreed with GDF.
