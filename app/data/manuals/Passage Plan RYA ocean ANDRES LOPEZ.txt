Considerations:

PIRIÁPOLIS - GIBRALTAR (5500 NM)

Winds and Currents:

It is essential to consider the prevailing winds and
currents during the crossing, as well as identify
potential ports of refuge if needed.

Route from Plata N (NE Course):

Northerly winds and south westerly currents
dominate, complicating navigation. These
conditions are particularly strong from October to
April, peaking between December and February.
Based on World Cruising Routes by Jimmy
Cornell, northerly currents have also been
recorded. Sailing is recommended between May
and July to avoid these adverse conditions.

Trade Winds:

From March to August, southeasterly trade winds
become more consistent, justifying the chosen
departure window. These winds will assist
navigation, especially after Cabo Frío, west of Rio
de Janeiro.

Brazilian Coast Traffic:

The Brazilian coastline is heavily trafficked,
particularly by small, poorly lit wooden fishing
vessels, which are difficult to detect on radar. lt
is advised to maintain at least a 50-mile offshore
distance to avoid collisions.

Coastal Navigation Hazards:

Navigating near the coast requires caution due
to regional hazards and variable wind patterns
often encountered in coastal waters.

Rio de Janeiro to Salvador de
Bahia:

After passing Rio de Janeiro, staying
close to shore to avoid significant
mileage offshore requires awareness
of the Arbolos Islands, which are
located within 50 miles. If the goal is
to stop at Salvador de Bahia,
proximity to these islands must be
accounted for.

Crossing the Equator
When deciding the best time and location to cross the equator, it is crucial to consider both
the point of origin and the destination. In this case, with the Strait of Gibraltar as the
destination, it is recommended to gain as much easting as possible prior to crossing.

Initial Route:

Ifthe vessel opts for a non-stop passage, routes close
to the Brazilian coastline should be avoided at the start
of the journey. This is because the region is dominated
by northeasterly winds, which can hinder progress.
Instead, an offshore route should be followed until the
southeasterly trade winds are encountered.

Equator Crossing Strategy:

The crossing should be made as far east as possible
to maximize the advantage of the northeasterly trade
winds encountered after passing through the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

Adjusting for NE Winds:

Should the vessel encounter persistent northeasterly winds that make it difficult to maintain
the desired course, alternative routes and potential ports of call must be considered as
contingencies. This ensures safety andflexibility in case weather conditions necessitate a
change in strategy.

35
Strait of Gibraltar Crossing Considerations
Current Directions:
Eastbound currents: Up to 7 knots.
Westbound currents: Up to 2 knots.

Planning the Crossing:

Timing the crossing is critical to take advantage of favorable eastbound currents when
entering the Mediterranean.

Keep the tide almanac for the current year at hand to plan the crossing efficiently.

High Tide in GIBRALTAR HT+1h in GIBRALTAR

Strait of Gibraltar Crossing

From High Tide (PM) to High Tide + 3 hours (PM+3), the currents in the Strait of Gibraltar
flow eastward, making this the ideal time to cross. The exact time of high tide can be
checked via Radio Tarifa, which provides accurate tidal updates.

36
Final Approach: Gibraltar Strait Crossing
After accounting for potential unforeseen events in the Atlantic Ocean, the voyage reaches
the Strait of Gibraltar. As previously mentioned, understanding the tidal currents is crucial for
a smooth and efficient crossing.

Favorable Current Window:
From high tide (PM) to approximately 5 hours after high tide, the currents flow eastward,
making this the optimal time to cross into the Mediterranean.

Preparation:
Monitor tidal updates via Radio Tarifa and align the vessel's schedule to take advantage of
the favorable current window for a more comfortable crossing.

Winds and Currents in the Mediterranean
Winds
This stage ofthe voyage, though simpler, requires attention due to the specific
characteristics of Mediterranean navigation. This zone, classified as Zone B, has short-range
communication, primarily conducted via VHF, with occasional mobile signal coverage.

Inthe Mediterranean, wind patterns and cycles differ
significantly, with various wind types to consider: Tramontana

Mistral: Strong northwesterly (NW) winds.
Vendaval: Strong southwesterly (SW) winds.
Sirocco: Warm southerly (S) winds.

Levante: Easterly (E) winds.

Gregale: Strong northeasterly (NE) winds.
Meltemi: Northeasterly (NE) winds, predominant Mediodía

in June.

For the month of June, Meltemi winds are most common.

These winds, an extension ofthe Asian Monsoons, are typically associated with stable and
pleasant weather conditions.

Currents and Tides
Currents:
Due to a water deficit in the Mediterranean caused by high evaporation rates, a significant
inflow current enters from the Atlantic through the Strait of Gibraltar.

Tides:

The average tidal range is
approximately 40 cm, which
negates the need for detailed tidal
studies for navigation within the
Mediterranean.
